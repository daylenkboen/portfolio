                                    <p>Our Scratch project, designed and modeled after the popular browser-game "World's Hardest Game", was 
                                created to be as satisfying when finally completed as the original game. Each level was designed using the 
                                program "Paint.NET", and every obstacle and monster was individually programmed based on it's position on 
                                the map. We were originally worried about using the "touching color" element, however, we encountered 
                                almost no problems. The only encumbrance we faced was on level 3, when the player often had difficulty 
                                moving through the spawn-point. A simple redesign of the spawn-point fixed it. I believe this project 
                                specifically helped with brainstorming for creative ideas. My partner and I were given experience into
                                what it's like to throw out and criticise ideas, and which ideas we could implement into the game - with 
                                the skills we had and time given. This experience has helped with every project sense. </p>

                            <p>The goal of this project was to create a multiplayer, interactive game from a given template. My partner
                                    and I went over many different methods of how to complete this point, but no matter the challenge we 
                                    constantly added new content - essential to gameplay as well as cosmetic changes. Both my partner and I 
                                    took the feedback given for our beta version - laggy gameplay and input, unsatisfactory controls, and 
                                    others - very seriously, and almost completely renovated the application. Unfortunately, though, we were 
                                    required to return to our previous version due to limitations of the MIT App Inventor Engines. I'm very 
                                    proud of where we had taken the game, and I'm grateful that I can share it. On the right, you can see both 
                                    our final version as well as what we planned to do if MIT App Inventor supported the application properly.
